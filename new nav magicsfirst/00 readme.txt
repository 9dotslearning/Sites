You have a good start on a responsive, two-level navbar. Here is the status:

- All the code is in the new nav magicsfirst folder.

- newnav.html contains the working code you wrote after following the video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkMIwNpK5jQ. It's working properly, but (of course) the links and styles need to be adapted to your website.

- newnav-COMPLETE.html is the same as newnav.html but also includes .wrapper and .contents classes and a link to poole.css.

- index-newnav.html is a copy of the main landing page that includes the new navbar. It's partially working. 

- styles/nav.css is the css for the new navbar. You need to move the menu code in currently in poole.css to nav.css.

- scripts/script.js contains the code that captures clicks to open/close the responsive sidebar menu.

- styles/poole-220823.css has the old responsive menu code removed but nothing new added - so probably not useful.


- To be done:
- - - Something is interfering with the styles for the heading and main paragraphs on index.html. Although the correct instructions are in poole.css, the font is too dark and too large, and the top margin is too small.
- - - Make the links active (add the refs)
- - - Colors of links and backgrounds
- - - How to highlight the current (selected) page in the menus
- - - Whether to include rollover colors as you mouse over links
- - - Change background color on submenus to be transparent
